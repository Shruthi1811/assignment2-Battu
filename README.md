###### New York 
New York is divided into five boroughs  **Brooklyn, Queens**, Staten Island, the Bronx, and the best-known of all, Manhattan. This is where you will find most of the city’s top attractions, such as the Empire State Building, Central Park, Times Square, the Chrysler Building and more. And ferries to the Statue of Liberty on Liberty Island depart from Lower Manhattan. And for the best views of Manhattan go to the Top of the Rock at the Rockefeller Centre. As it is most happening place in the world, I like to visit that place.
