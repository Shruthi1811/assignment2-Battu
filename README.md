###### New York 
New York is divided into five boroughs  **Brooklyn**, Queens, Staten Island, the Bronx, and the best-known of all, Manhattan. This is where you will find most of the cityâ€™s top attractions, such as the Empire State Building, Central Park, Times Square, the Chrysler Building and more. And ferries to the Statue of Liberty on Liberty Island depart from Lower **Manhattan**. And for the best views of Manhattan go to the Top of the Rock at the Rockefeller Centre. As it is most happening place in the world, I like to visit that place.
